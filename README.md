Homework on probation in a Research Group Neuron. 


**Main idea of the project**

*Preprocessing (Preprocessing.ipynb):*
Allows for loading and cleaning raw data, removing outliers and missing values, as well as standardizing the signal to make further processing more efficient.

*Signal filtering (Signal_filtering.ipynb):*
Demonstrates how to use different types of filters (low-pass, high-pass, and bandpass) and how to assess their effectivenessâ€”through comparisons in both the time and frequency domains.
